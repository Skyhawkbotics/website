								<h3>What We Learn</h3>
								<p>In the FIRST Tech Challenge, you learn many skills that apply to real life through a new game challenge each year. Some of these skills are:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>CAD (Computer Assisted Design):</strong> Members can learn how to use professional 3D modeling software such as Autodesk Fusion to turn ideas into reality.
									</li>
									<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Members can learn hands-on about the assembly and electrical of robots, with motors, servos, arms, and many other mechanical divisions
									</li>
									<li><strong>Programming:</strong> Members learn the programming language Java, a popular, versatile, and widely used object-oriented programming language, through Android Studio, a software development platform for developing Android Applications to code the robot for gamepad control and autonomous movement.</li>
									<li><strong>Professional Presentation & Communication:</strong> Members will have the opportunity to present their work to Judges to receive awards and participate in discussing strategy with other FTC teams during the competition
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>What We Do</h3>
								<p>Aside from learning and participating in the engineering design process and how to use fundamental life skills such as CAD (Computer Assisted Design), code, teamwork, and communication, members of the Hawkbot1cs family participate in many activities serving the community and more:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>We have an active presence at many elementary and middle school science fairs, such as Whitford, Hiteon, Sexton Mountain, and more, introducing and presenting opportunities of robotics to parents and students.
									</li>
									<li>We collaborate with other organizations and high school clubs across different schools.
									</li>
									<li>We create, host, and participate in fundraising events to raise money to buy parts.</li>
									<li>We teach and work with other FTC teams, locally and internationally.</li>
									<li>We apply to grants and sponsorships with businesses as a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization. As a result, students will learn how to write and communicate professionally with businesses.</li>
								</ul>
