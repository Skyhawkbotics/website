# `src` Folder
## Overview
This folder contains all the website files and serves as the root for the domain name. All pages are kept in their own folder, and the HTML file is named `index.html`.

## Creating A New Page
To create a new page in the website, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in `src` and rename it to the path you want in the URL.
2. Copy your desired template from the `Templates` folder.
3. Rename the file to `index.html`.
4. Make the needed changes.

## Subfolders
Most of the folders in the `src` folder go to a webpage. The exceptions are:

-   `assets`: This folder contains files shared across multiple pages to ensure the website looks and functions as intended.
-   `components`: This folder contains common elements such as the navbar to reduce code duplication.
-   `Templates`: This folder contains templates to make new webpages.
