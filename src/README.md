## `src` Folder
### Overview
This folder contains all of the website files, and is the root for the domain name. All pages are kept in their own folder, and the HTML file is named `index.html`.

### Creating A New Page
To create a new page in the website, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in `src` and rename it to the path you want in the URL.
2. Copy your desired template from the `Templates` folder.
3. Make the needed changes.

### Subfolders
Most of the folders in the `src` folder go to a webpage. The exceptions are:

-   `assets`: This folder contains files shared between multiple pages to make the website look and function as intended.
-   `components`: This folder contains common elements such as the navbar to reduce code duplication.
-   `Templates`: This folder contains templates to make new webpages.
