										<h3>Why a Nonprofit?</h3>
										<p>Over two years ago,  members of the team became interested in altering the way our team operates. Previously, we were a club activity organized by the school district, which means that we must follow strict guidelines when making purchases, attending events, paying for food and lodging, etc. In order to have more freedom and play a more significant role in the community, some of the youth members worked together to form an Oregon-incorporated nonprofit organization: Hawkbot1cs. 
										</p>
										<h3> Our Mission Statement</h3>
										<blockquote>“Hawkbot1cs has been organized to provide access to STEM education for youth of all backgrounds in our community free of cost or fees. Through unrestricted youth participation in designing, building, testing, promoting, and competing with robots, We believe we prepare students from all walks of life for the everchanging future. Through Hawkbot1cs, we aim to provide students the opportunity to learn complex STEM skills, but also develop essential skills such as leadership, communication, teamwork, and more.”</blockquote>
										<p>We believe that easy access means that there is no barrier between students and access to STEM learning, no matter who you are or where you come from. Especially with other teams in our area requiring entrance fees to join, we decided that <strong> the best entrance fee was none at all</strong>. To execute this required a long journey and a LOT of research! Navigating the complex legal structures surrounding operating nonprofits was especially a challenge, and through investigating many parts of a nonprofit, from filing <a href="#">Articles of Incorporation</a>, to writing legal bylaws that covered all of our bases, identifying what responsibilities we would have to the government and community once we had been incorporated. The IRS also recognizes us as a 501(c)(3). We intend to continue expanding on our current programs to increase our impact on our community, partnering with <em>FIRST<sup>®</sup></em> Lego League Robotics teams in the future, hosting summer camps, and organizing regional STEM events, all of this will while providing FREE access to <em>FIRST<sup>®</sup></em>, regardless of who you are, and your background.</p>
