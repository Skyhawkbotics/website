### V2 Information

-   This is Version 2 of the Hawkbot1cs website
-   V2 is easier to edit and change using basic `html`, as this version has removed `.svelte`.
-   New pages can now be created and ready to push in minutes by duplicating and modifying an `.html` file in `src/routes/Templates`.
-   The navbar and footer can now be modified site-wide from a single file.

### /src/assets

-   This is the assets folder.

### /src/routes

-   This is the folder where the pages are stored.
-   All webpages should be called  `index.html `


### /src/components

-   This is the components folder.
-   These are referenced in the pages to reduce code duplication.
